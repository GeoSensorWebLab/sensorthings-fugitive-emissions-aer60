== Conformance Class Abstract Test Suite (Normative)

This section contains the conformance classes for the OGC Integrated Methane Sensor Web for Emissions Management Best Practice - Part I - Fugitive Emissions Management based on AER Directive 60.
The Fugitive Emissions Management (FEM) SensorThings API (STA) service needs to pass all the conformance tests defined in this section as well as the https://docs.ogc.org/is/18-088/18-088.html#_conformance_class_abstract_test_suite_normative[OGC SensorThings API Part 1: Sensing Version 1.1] Conformance Class Abstract Test Suit.
