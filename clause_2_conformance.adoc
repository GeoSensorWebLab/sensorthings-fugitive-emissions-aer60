== Conformance
This OGC Best Practice (OGC BP) defines a SensorThings API for fugitive methane emissions management based on the Alberta Energy Regulatorâ€™s regulatory requirement for fugitive emissions management https://www.aer.ca/regulating-development/rules-and-directives/directives/directive-060[AER Directive 60 (2021)].

Conformance with this OGC BP shall be checked using all the relevant tests specified in annex a (normative) of this document.

All requirement classes and conformance classes described in this document are owned by the document(s) identified.

The following table lists the requirement classes defined in this OGC BP.

[NOTE]
The text in the _Requirements class id_ and _Requirements_ columns in the following table is the path fragment that,
when appended to the URI: http://www.opengis.net/spec/imsw-fm-aer60/1.0, provides the URI that
can be used to unambiguously identify the requirement and the conformance class.
