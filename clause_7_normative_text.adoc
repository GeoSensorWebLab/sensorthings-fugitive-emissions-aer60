This requirement defines the mandatory properties and relations of the "FeatureOfInterest" entity related to the "Observations" of the three mandatory "Datastreams". In the context of the fugitive emissions, the "FeatureOfInterest" of a fugitive emissions "Observation" is where the leaks occur. In AER Directive 60, the "FeatureOfInterest" is modelled as a site. In some cases, a reporting facility "Thing" can have more than one site, such as wells, controlled tanks, process units, or wellhead https://static.aer.ca/prd/documents/manuals/Manual015.pdf#page=17[[AER Manual015 Figure 1]] and https://static.aer.ca/prd/documents/manuals/Manual015.pdf#page=19[[AER Manual015 Figure 3]]. The following figure describes the relationship between a reporting facility "Thing" and "FeaturesOfInterest".

.Thing and FeatureOfInterest Relationship
image::figures/FIGn.002.png[Thing and FeatureOfInterest Relationship]

An Observation results in a value being assigned to a phenomenon. The phenomenon is a property of a feature, the latter being the FeatureOfInterest of the Observation [OGC and ISO 19156:2011]. In the context of this best practice, the FeatureOfInterest is the site can be the Location of the Thing. For example, the FeatureOfInterest of a wifi-connect thermostat can be the Location of the thermostat (i.e., the living room where the thermostat is located in). In the case of remote sensing, the FeatureOfInterest can be the geographical area or volume that is being sensed.
