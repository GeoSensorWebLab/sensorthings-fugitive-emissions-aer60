=== Requirement Class: FeatureOfInterest

include::requirements/requirements_class_6.adoc[]

==== Requirement 13
This requirement defines the mandatory properties and relations of the "FeatureOfInterest" entity related to the "Observations" of the three mandatory "Datastreams." In the context of fugitive emissions, the "FeatureOfInterest" of fugitive emissions "Observation" is where the leaks occur. In AER Directive 60, the "FeatureOfInterest" is modelled as a site. In some cases, a _reporting facility_ called "Thing" can have more than one site, such as wells, controlled tanks, process units, or wellhead https://static.aer.ca/prd/documents/manuals/Manual015.pdf#page=17[[AER Manual015 Figure 1]] and https://static.aer.ca/prd/documents/manuals/Manual015.pdf#page=19[[AER Manual015 Figure 3]]. The following figure describes the relationship between a _reporting facility_ "Thing" and "FeaturesOfInterest."

.Thing and FeatureOfInterest Relationship
image::figures/FIGn.002.png[Thing and FeatureOfInterest Relationship]

An Observation results in a value that is being assigned to a phenomenon. The phenomenon is a property of a feature, the latter being the FeatureOfInterest of the Observation [OGC and ISO 19156:2011]. In the context of this best practice, the FeatureOfInterest is the _site_ and can be identified by the site's location. For example, the FeatureOfInterest of a wifi-connected thermostat can be the thermostat's location (_i.e._, the living room where the thermostat is located). In the case of remote sensing, FeatureOfInterest can be the geographical area or volume that is being sensed.
