In particular, the word “shall” (not “must”) is the verb form used to indicate a requirement to be strictly followed to conform to this Best Practice.

For the purposes of this document, the following additional terms and definitions apply.

*Facility ID*   A unique facility identification code, with 4 letters and 7 numbers (e.g., ABWP1234567), assigned by Petrinex to each facility [https://static.aer.ca/prd/documents/directives/Directive060.pdf[AER Directive 60]].

*Fugitive Emissions*   Unintentional releases of hydrocarbons to the atmosphere [https://static.aer.ca/prd/documents/directives/Directive060.pdf[AER Directive 60]].

*Fugitive Emissions Screenings*   Site-wide evaluations where the primary purpose is to identify fugitive emissions (e.g., from open thief hatches). These are less comprehensive than fugitive emission surveys [https://static.aer.ca/prd/documents/directives/Directive060.pdf[AER Directive 60]].

*Fugitive Emission Surveys*   Site-wide evaluations that use equipment-based methods to detect and identify sources of fugitive emissions for repair. These surveys are considered comprehensive evaluations that can assist in reducing both small volumes and large volumes of fugitive emissions [https://static.aer.ca/prd/documents/directives/Directive060.pdf[AER Directive 60]].

*Petrinex*   Canada’s Petroleum Information Network

*Site*   The area defined by the boundaries of a surface lease for upstream oil and gas facilities and wells (pads counted as one lease) [https://static.aer.ca/prd/documents/directives/Directive060.pdf[AER Directive 60]].

*Leak*   A leak is a way (usually an opening) for fluid to escape a container or fluid-containing system, such as a tank, through which the contents of the container can escape or outside matter can enter the container.

(b) by or under the authority of the Governor in Council

*Fugitive Emissions Management Program*   A plan and supporting systems to systematically detect and manage fugitive emissions. Fugitive Emissions Management Programs are intended to complement a duty holder's overall emissions reduction strategy [https://static.aer.ca/prd/documents/directives/Directive060.pdf[AER Directive 60]].

*Vent Emission*   The intentional controlled release of un-combusted gases directly to the atmosphere .
