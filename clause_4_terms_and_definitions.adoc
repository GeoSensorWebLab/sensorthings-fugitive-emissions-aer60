== Terms and Definitions
This document uses the terms defined in Sub-clause 5.3 of [OGC 06-121r8], which is based on the ISO/IEC Directives, Part 2, Rules for the structure and drafting of International Standards. In particular, the word “shall” (not “must”) is the verb form used to indicate a requirement to be strictly followed to conform to this Best Practice.

For the purposes of this document, the following additional terms and definitions apply.

*Facility ID*   A unique facility identification code, with 4 letters and 7 numbers (e.g., ABWP1234567), assigned by Petrinex to each facility.

*Fugitive Emissions*   Unintentional releases of hydrocarbons to the atmosphere.

*Fugitive Emissions Screenings*   Site-wide evaluations where the primary purpose is to identify fugitive emissions (e.g., from open thief hatches). These are less comprehensive than fugitive emission surveys.

*Fugitive Emission Surveys*   Site-wide evaluations that use equipment-based methods to detect and identify sources of fugitive emissions for repair. These surveys are considered comprehensive evaluations that can assist in reducing both small volumes and large volumes of fugitive emissions.

*Petrinex*   Canada’s Petroleum Information Network

*Site*   The area defined by the boundaries of a surface lease for upstream oil and gas facilities and wells (pads counted as one lease).
