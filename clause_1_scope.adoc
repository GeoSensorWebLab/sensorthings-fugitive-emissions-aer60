== Scope
Methane (CH4) is one of the most potent greenhouse gases, and the comparative impact of methane is 25 times greater than CO2 over a 100-year period http://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar4/[[IPCC 2007]]. Methane is an invisible and odourless gas, and it is very labour intensive and time consuming in order to detect and repair the leaks. Current methane emission management solutions are fragmented and being developed without standards, ultimately leading to a complex network of incompatible sensing solutions that need to interrelate but are not possible. However there is no single methane sensing technology that can meet the accuracy, spatio-temporal resolution, and low-cost requirements. There is a need to interconnect the heterogeneous existing and emerging methane sensing technologies, ranging from satellites, drones, fixed-wing fly-overs, vehicle-based systems, continuous in-situ monitoring stations, to handheld Optical Gas Imaging (OGI) devices. An effective methane emissions management solution needs an integrated methane sensor web. OGC Sensor Web Enablement (SWE) provides the fundamental standard building blocks for the integrated methane sensor web.

This OGC Best Practice (OGC BP) defines a SensorThings API for fugitive methane emissions management. Regulations play a critical role for methane emissions reduction, and how methane emissions are detected, repaired, and managed highly dependent on the local regulation. This OGC BP is designed based on the Alberta Energy Regulator's regulatory requirement for fugitive emissions management https://static.aer.ca/prd/documents/directives/Directive060.pdf[[AER Directive 60]].

This OGC BP document provides a data model and API for the exchange of fugitive emissions observation data and the necessary metadata, both within and between different organizations.  For example, it can be used for leak detection and repair service providers to prepare and exchange fugitive emissions observation data with the oil and gas producers. Oil and gas producers can also use the OGC BP to exchange fugitive emissions data within the organization and with regulators.

Venting and combustion methane emissions are out of scope in this BP, and they are on the roadmap.

=== Roadmap

This OGC BP is the first part of the OGC Integrated Methane Sensor Web for Emissions Management BPs. We plan to publish a series of OGC BPs for methane emissions management, including fugitive and venting emissions. The goal is to develop the building blocks for an integrated Methane Emissions Sensor Web, enabling seamless flows of observation data from SensorThings nodes with heterogeneous sensing sources (i.e., multiple disparate methane observation systems), to SensorThings nodes with analytics-ready data (i.e., a aggregated methane emissions datalake), and eventually to SensorThings nodes with compliance-ready data (i.e., data compliant to various regulatory organizations in different jurisdictions).

Figure below shows the roadmap of the different OGC BPs to be developed and their relationship.

=== Design Goals

The OGC BP and its series have the following design goals:

. Modular: the different parts a methane emissions management system can be separated and reassembled, with the benefit of flexibility, future-proof, and variety in use.
. Simple: the design is concise, easily testable, easy to implement, and developer friendly.
. Interoperable: whenever possible follows international open standards
. Scalable: is able to grow in terms of number of sensors, types of sensors, and volume of data without sacrificing performances.
